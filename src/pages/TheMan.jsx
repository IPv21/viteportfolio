          Hello! My name is Matthew Shuman. Thank you for taking some time out
          of your day to view my page. Born in California, raised in Lancaster,
          I came to Philly after Covid. I'm a lifelong cook, having done
          everything from flipping eggs at Cracker Barrel to being Sous Chef at
          a 5 Star restaurant. Looking for a new career path, I decided to
          pursue my love of computers and began researching IT courses on
          different platforms. I then found the UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp and
          decided to take the plunge. I'm excited to see where this new path
          takes me!
        </p>

        A dedicated team member with a passion for learning, I'm looking for a
        company that will allow me to learn and grow as a developer. An avid
        runner, I have completed several half marathons and one full marathon.
        The mental toughness and dedication required to complete a marathon is
        something I bring to every aspect of my life. I'm looking forward to
        bringing that same dedication to my new career.
